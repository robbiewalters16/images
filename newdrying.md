#### Tips on usage:
- We have found that the quickest way to stack and dry your bars is to stand them on the long edge. See diagram below.
- Space about1/8" (3mm) between the bars and about 1/4" (6mm) between the rows 
- The average 3.5 to 4 oz. (100g to 120g) bar size can stack about 100 to a tray (up to about 25 lbs. (11.4 kg)
- If the bars are under 3/4" (19mm), you may need to place a row on top of the bars, straddling the rows. See diagram below.
- This method works very well for small sample bars, even down to 3/8" (9mm) or less. This locks them together and allows you to move the tray around.
- Speed drying by placing fans around trays. The slotted design and open sides allow maximum air flow around product.

### FAQ: 
---	
**Question:**
How do we reduce our soap drying and curing time?
**Answer:**
Increasing your air flow between your bars is the best way to do this. Our Soap Drying Trays are specially designed to do this! They can decrease your drying time by 25% or more. 

If you want to decrease your drying time even more, try placing fans around your trays for maxium air flow. 
 	
**Question:**
How do you move the trays around?
**Answer:**
You can put your trays on Tray Dollies. We carry several options. For larger operations a narrow pallet works very well where several stacks can be placed and moved with a pallet jack.

**Question:**
How high can you stack the trays?
**Answer:**
Around 6’ (1.8 meters) is average but you can go 7’ or 8’ (2 to 2.5 meters) if you want to.

**Question:**
The drying racks are wonderful, but from there should the Soap Bars be in cardboard, plastic, bins, open, or closed or what??? (until Soap Bars get into stores)

**Answer:**
You can just push the soap together on a drying tray and then put a piece of liner paper or butcher paper over the tray. This holds the scent in better than spaced apart, yet lets the soap breath.

However, you can put them in cardboard boxes but make sure there is some breathing room on top and don’t line with plastic. In humid climates the soap can sweat, if too tightly enclosed. Plastic bins work but should be vented in humid climates.

If you are in a dry climate, you may find you can store in air tight containers or tightly packed in boxes.
